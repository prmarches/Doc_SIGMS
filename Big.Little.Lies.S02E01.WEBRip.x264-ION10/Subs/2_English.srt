this year, aren't you?

174
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:38,124
Well, it's my otter blood,
Madeline.

175
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,792
-Hi, Madeline Martha Mackenzie.
-Lisa Coolidge.

176
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,583
Anyway, it was
a beautiful service, Warren.

177
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,333
WARREN NIPPAL: (LAUGHS)
Well, thank you, Madeline,

178
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,249
I like to think of it more
as an assembly.

179
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,583
A service
is for when someone dies,

180
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,583
you know,
like a school fundraiser.

181
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,792
You're not seriously
gonna go there, are you?

182
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,750
My hope is that
you don't go there, Madeline.

183
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,999
Now, let's remember
a lot of last year's mishigas

184
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,041
were lovingly stirred up by you.

185
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,708
MELISSA:
Anybody want a red velvet?

186
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,792
-Melissa!
-Cupcake?

187
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,792
MADELINE: I'll take one
for each thigh.

188
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,249
MELISSA: Absolutely.

189
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,958
I don't even like to chew.
I just shove 'em down.

190
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,833
Maybe you can give one to Warren
so he can shove it too.

191
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:15,041
WARREN: (CHUCKLES)
And we're off.

192
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,124
-MADELINE: Bonnie.
-It's a classy crop of moms,

193
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,249
these ones. Those gluten-free?

194
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,708
MADELINE: Tahoe was good?

195
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,249
Uh, yeah, it was good.
Nathan caught a lot of fish.

196
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,166
Wow.

197
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,333
BONNIE CARLSON:
And I hear you're selling houses
like crazy. That's very cool.

198
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,166
Oh my gosh, in Monterey,
it is like printing money.

199
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:30,875
I should have done this
years ago.

200
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,083
-I'm gonna go find Skye.
-Okay.

201
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,083
Okay. Are you two fighting?

202
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,625
Uh, no.
Actually, I almost wish we were.

203
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:45,083
No, she's... she's been acting
like that for a while now.

204
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,541
Acting like what?

205
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,792
Shut down. Like, withdrawn.

206
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,083
Oh, you mean
you're not having sex.

207
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,124
Okay, don't forget
that Abigail has

208
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,083
-her college counselor meeting
at 2:00 p.m.
-Yeah, yeah, I got your--

209
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,667
I got your emails.
Six of them this morning.

210
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,958
-Good. Thank you.
-This is her future, Nathan.

211
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,833
Nice to be back.

212
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm told that my daughter,
Amabella,

213
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,083
is going to be in your class.
So exciting.

214
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,500
Yes, very nice to meet you.

215
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,958
Um, she has an IQ of 152.
Genius level, right.

216
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,249
That's a very high number.
Life's about give and take.

217
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,375
I expect you to take care
of my daughter.

218
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,083
Pay special attention.
And, again, welcome.

219
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,375
Um, oh, oh, oh. (CHUCKLES)
And...

220
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,958
my Amabella was bullied
last year.

221
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,917
I mean, in like,
biting and choking.

222
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,208
So, we're gonna make sure
that doesn't happen again.

223
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,833
-(BAND PLAYS)
-RENATA KLEIN: Oh.

224
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,083
Oops. Sorry.

225
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,500
Sorry.

226
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,416
Here's my problem
with the whole meditation thing.

227
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,875
It's like you shut out
the world,

228
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,249
but you also shut out
your friends,

229
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,792
which is a little bit weird.

230
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,583
And also, does she look funny?
Something's not right.

231
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,458
-Are you talking about Bonnie?
-Uh-huh.

232
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,458
Like, she's off. But she was off
before she went to Tahoe.

233
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,708
Unplugged is one thing,

234
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,667
but unhinged
is a total other thing.

235
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,958
-(HORN BLARES)
-Hey! Asshole! Hey!

236
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,875
-Oh, hon.
-Why are you cutting me off?

237
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,166
-Honey. The horn. The horn.
-Dick! I just think we--

238
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,249
Oh, yeah, sorry.

239
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,041
Once I lean in,
you know how I am.

240
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:09,208
-CELESTE: Indeed.
-I think we need to talk to her

241
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,708
and see where her head is at.

242
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,375
-CELESTE: Do you?
-Do you want to get a coffee?

243
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,500
By the way, did you see Renata

244
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,708
getting up
that new teacher's ass?

245
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,917
I thought she was gonna have
to pull out her snorkel.

246
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,083
CELESTE: Easy. I'm gonna go
to the ladies' room;

247
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,208
-can you get me an Americano?
-MADELINE: Will do.

248
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,041
-Hey, Bruna.
-BRUNA: Hey, Madeline.

249
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:28,875
MADELINE: Wow, do you sell weed?
It smells like weed over here.

250
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,875
-Keep the change.
-BRUNA: Thank you so much.

251
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,667

-(DISTANT CHATTER)

and a bran muffin?

253
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,500
-...that's a thing?
-MADELINE: Mary Louise?

254
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,917
-Hi. Madeline.
-MARY LOUISE: Hi.

255
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,500
-Madeline!
-Yes.

256
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,416
-So nice to see you again.
-I'm Celeste's friend. Yes.

257
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,750
How have you been?

258
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Good, good. The kids are good.
How are you?

259
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,375
I can't complain.

260
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,999
Actually, I can.

261
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,625
My son is dead.

262
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,375
But Celeste tells me that
you continue to be so helpful

263
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,166
with her and the boys and...

264
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,208
She should just get
a proper housekeeper.

265
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,708
-You're very short.
-(SCOFFS) Excuse me?

266
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,583
I don't mean it
in a negative way.

267
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,875
MADELINE: Oh. (CHUCKLES)

268
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,500
Maybe I do.

269
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:18,375
I find little people to be
untrustworthy.

270
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,500
(CHUCKLES) My apologies.
It's just that I'm...

271
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,541
I pride myself on being
a very good judge of character,

272
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,291
but you have always presented
such a difficult read.

273
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,041
You know,
you seem like a nice person.

274
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:37,625
Loving. But also,
you strike me as a wanter.

275
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,792
-A-- A wanter?
-Mm.

276
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,333
You know...

277
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,625
there are people in-- in life
who content themselves

278
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,708
with what they have,
and then there are others

279
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,375
who just... just want.

280
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm not a wanter.

281
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,083
Oh, you don't have to take it
personally.

282
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,917
Anyway, I'm a wanter myself.

283
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,750
You know what I want?
I want Perry back.

284
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,999
I wanna know what happened
that night.

285
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,958
And I-- I'm very tempted
to ask you,

286
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,792
but I doubt I would get
the, uh...

287
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
the truth, would I?

288
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,041
Your son lost his balance
and he fell.

289
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:19,166
Yes, that seems to be
the company line.

290
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,833

you keep.

What the hell was that?

294
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,833
That was a very strong position.

295
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,375
And I didn't like it!

296
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,625

300
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,958
Sorry, I didn't recognize you
at first.

301
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,792

Yeah, it's fabulous.

304
00:14:57,124 --> 00:14:58,833
I always felt a little
self-conscious, you know.

305
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,208
About your breasts?

306
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,625
-My nose.
-Oh.

307
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,416
Now, nobody notices it so much.

308
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,625
Everybody notices these though.
And that pisses Joseph off.

00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,458

00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,625

-That you're to blame.

-Did you know about this?
-No, I swear.

511
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,958
You were with her all summer
in Tahoe,

512
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,458
and you knew nothing
about this?

513

-Madeline, I didn't know.
-And what about Bonnie?

514
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,541
Did she know about this
"fuck college" plan?

00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,833
Unbelievable.

517

You know if she doesn't go
to college,

518
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,124
she won't have a life.

519
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,792
She'll just be serving Big Macs
and French fries,
and that'll be her life.

for her, Nathan?
-Stop, stop. Stop yelling at me.

-Stop yelling at me.
-What? You know you bear
some responsibility here, right?

-NATHAN: I do?
-You're her father.

-NATHAN: Oh, okay.
-This is her senior year,

524
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,875
she's on the cusp of her life,

525

in Tahoe!

Well, I thought I might look
for a small flat here in town,

with the boys

Mary Louise, I realize
that you're still grieving,

548
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,999
and that you've been through

549
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,917
a tremendous amount
of heartbreak,

550
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:06,458
but I don't care for the way
you spoke to me before.

551
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,500
It was rude,
and I didn't deserve it.

MARY LOUISE: The truth is,
it had nothing to do with you.

555
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,041
When I was in boarding school,
I had-- I had a best friend,

556
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:21,833
or so I thought,

557
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,416
who revealed herself
to be quite treacherous,

558
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,750
and, uh, caused me
a lot of pain.

559
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,875
So... she was just
an itty-bitty little thing

560
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,333
with a big, bubbly personality
that, um...

561
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,875
was designed to hide...

562
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,792
that she was utterly vapid
inside.

563
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,625

564
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,416
that I suppose I punish you
for that.
